        In fields of gold, beneath the sun's gentle gaze,
        A mother's love, in myriad ways,
        Through whispers of leaves, not heard, but felt,
        In sunflower eyes, where warmth does melt.
    
        Tiny hands, soil-kissed, reach for the sky,
        Seeds of tomorrow, in the ground they lie,
        Growth mirrors life, in ups and downs,
        In every smile, and in each frown.
    
        Sunflowers tall, stand proud and true,
        A testament to the love I drew,
        From you, dear mother, in every hour,
        You are my sun, my rain, my flower.
    
        On this day, I offer a bloom,
        A sunflower bright, to dispel the gloom,
        Its petals hold, my thanks, my love,
        Under the watchful skies above.
    
        For in this life, if I should wander,
        Of your love, I'll always ponder,
        Mother's Day, with sunflowers blend,
        My love for you, it knows no end.
