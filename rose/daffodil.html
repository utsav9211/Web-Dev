    Valley where sunlight softly treads,
    A shadow looms, quietly spreads.
    Once daffodils in abundance bloomed,
    Now lies silence, beauty entombed.
    
    Beneath the moon, a solitary figure,
    Hands that played life's abridger.
    Among petals, yellow turned grey,
    The daffodil murderer walks away.
    
    No more laughter springtime brings,
    Just whispers of sorrow that clings.
    A garden once vibrant, now a grave's disguise,
    Underneath the ever-watchful skies.
    
    Yet, darkness reveals a single flower's stand,
    Defiant bloom, ignoring demands.
    A symbol of hope, amidst despair,
    Reminder that beauty can emerge anywhere.
