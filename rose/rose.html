        Moonlight drapes, rose in bloom,
        Silent tales of love, it assumes.
        Petals soft, under starlit gloom,
        Guarding love, in its perfumed plumes.
    
        Daybreak finds, shadows flee,
        Rose stands proud, love's decree.
        Each thorn, a story, a plea,
        For love as wild, as free.
    
        Evening falls, petals close,
        Rose whispers love, only it knows.
        In each bloom, a promise grows,
        Love, in silence, forever glows.
