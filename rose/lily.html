        Blooming in shaded groves, they softly sway,
        Pure white bells in a green array,
        A fragrant whisper fills the air,
        Of happiness beyond compare.
    
        Delicate blooms, they humbly bow,
        With grace and beauty, they endow,
        A secret strength within their core,
        Whispers of tales from days of yore.
    
        Toxic charm in innocence dressed,
        A paradox the heart confessed,
        Lily of the Valleyâ€™s grace,
        In nature's dance, they find their place.
